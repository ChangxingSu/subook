## üéØ Goal
The central focus of this template was to expand the use of **the margin** in order to include; simple marginnotes, numbered side‚Äìnotes, sidecite,marginfigures, and margintables. 

The secondary motivation was to include a list of
preloaded packages and provide  elegant and colorful theorem  environment that any bioinformatics or CS students would require while type‚Äìsetting notes. 

Lastly, there are a few stylistic improvements that allow for better readability.

### üõ† Compilation
This template compiles with standard xelatex. However, you will need to compile the bibliography, index and glossary separately to the template itself.

For example, to compile a LaTeX project whose main document is `subook.tex`, use following commands for the first compilation.:
```sh
# First step: xelatex
xelatex -no-pdf --interaction=nonstopmode subook
# Second Step: biber
biber subook
# Third Step: xelatex
xelatex -no-pdf --interaction=nonstopmode subook
# Fourth Step: xelatex
xelatex --interaction=nonstopmode subook
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks
Actually, this class is not completely 
original, but it is a blend of all the best ideas that I have found in a 
number of guides, tutorials, blogs and tex.stackexchange.com posts. It is precisely because I am in such a friendly and open source community that I can make such a template.
