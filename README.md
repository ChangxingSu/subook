## Goal
The central focus of this template was to expand the use of the margin in order to include; simple marginnotes, numbered side–notes, marginfigures, and margintables. 

The secondary motivation was to include a list of
preloaded packages that any physics or mathematics students would require while type–setting notes. 

Lastly, there are a few stylistic improvements that allow for better readability.
